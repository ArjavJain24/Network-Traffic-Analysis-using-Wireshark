## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Protocol identification (HTTP, DNS, TCP)
- Traffic filtering using Wireshark display filters
- Detection of unusual traffic volume
- Identification of potential scanning behavior

---

## 📊 Sample Findings
- Repeated DNS queries to unknown domains
- Excessive SYN packets indicating scanning activity
- Plaintext HTTP traffic exposure

---

## Outcome
Enhanced skills in network-based attack detection and defensive monitoring.

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Packet inspection techniques
- Network-based threat detection
- Defensive traffic monitoring

---

## 📌 Future Improvements
- IDS rule correlation
- Malicious traffic labeling
- PCAP automation analysis
